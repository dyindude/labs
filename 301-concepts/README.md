#higher level DNS concepts
- root DNS servers - ref: https://www.iana.org/domains/root/servers
- TLDs (top level domains)/domain structure
  - e.g. could you make a zone for this.really.long.zone.name.a.b.c.d.foo.bar.mylongdomainname.com? (spoilers: yes)
- local domains ???? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.local
- glue records? (more advanced topic, we haven't gotten to setting up a real domain yet)
  - for using ns1.example.com as authoritative for example.com, get out of the circular dependency of figuring out wtf server do I get DNS from?

- reverse dns (maybe another 2xx lab for this)

- master/slave dns servers
- Active Directory
