# dyindude/labs
This repository is to be used as a guide for learning about different foundational IT concepts.

The files in the root directory provide instructions on how to get up and going with Vagrant and Virtualbox, the only two pieces of software you will need to run any of the labs on your local system.

The subfolders are split up into different topics with labs aimed at a variety of skill levels. Regardless of your current knowledge, I welcome any and all feedback.

# How the labs work
- [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) is a software for running virtual machines on your system.
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is a software for describing development environments built on virtual machines with text files called Vagrantfiles. With a Vagrantfile, you can build the environment outlined within VirtualBox by simply running `vagrant up` from the command line.
  - While Vagrant supports other virtualization providers, VirtualBox and Vagrant work well together without any additional configuration. This is why I have chosen them as the basis for my labs.

# Setting up the environment
In order to run any lab, you will need to install both tools:
- [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

In addition, it is recommended that you install a `git` client for your OS.
- [Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- Linux: install using your package manager
  - ubuntu/debian: `sudo apt-get install git`
  - rhel/centos/fedora: `sudo yum install git`
- OSX: run `xcode-select --install` from the terminal

# Testing the environment
After all of the above software has been installed, open a terminal of your choice:
- Windows: `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `babun`
- Linux: `gnome-terminal`, `urxvt`, `xterm` etc
- OSX: `Terminal.app`, [iTerm2](https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2)

Clone this repo with git by running:

`git clone https://github.com/dyindude/labs.git`

`cd` into the `labs` folder and run the command `vagrant up`. Vagrant will download the `ubuntu/xenial64` and start a virtual machine in the background.

Once the VM has been started and you return to your shell's prompt, try logging into the VM with `vagrant ssh`

## Example:
```
$ vagrant up
Bringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
==> default: Importing base box 'ubuntu/xenial64'...
==> default: Matching MAC address for NAT networking...
==> default: Checking if box 'ubuntu/xenial64' is up to date...
==> default: Setting the name of the VM: labs_default_1510623605345_58237
==> default: Clearing any previously set network interfaces...
==> default: Preparing network interfaces based on configuration...
    default: Adapter 1: nat
...
    default: Guest Additions Version: 5.0.40
    default: VirtualBox Version: 5.2
==> default: Mounting shared folders...
    default: /vagrant => /home/dyindude/projects/labs
$ vagrant ssh
