# DNS 101-concepts
- This lab will provide some high level information with respect to DNS and how it operates in networks large and small.

# What is DNS?

DNS stands for **Domain Name System**. At a high level, you can think of it as a standard for resolving a "human readable" name to a "machine readable" name - like a phonebook.

Systems in networks (both local LANs and on the Internet) rely on IP addresses to know how and where to route traffic. However, this presents a few challenges:

- An IP address, such as `172.217.9.142` can be difficult for a human to remember.
- Often times, for redundancy, applications will be served from multiple machines on different IP addresses.
- DNS helps simplify this problem by allowing humans to only have to know a "human readable" name to access a service (such as `www.google.com`)
