# shell
This repository is a collection of labs to use for learning about navigating command line shells in Linux/UNIX.

Please follow the instructions in https://github.com/dyindude/vagrant-lab to set up your environment before downloading this repo.

Each subfolder in this repo is a different lab. Simply navigate to one of the subfolders, open `README.md` in that folder (or just open it from github in your browser), and run `vagrant up`.

When done with the lab, be sure to exit your shell and run `vagrant destroy` from the lab's folder
